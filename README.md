# public_key_teaching
This is teaching material related to public/private key cryptography. It is intended to follow a lecture on the topic. A write up will be in a textbook on networks teaching. 

The powerpoint are the slides I showed during the exercise.

The word document contains the materials I printed. The public/secret messages at the end should be replaced with messages appropriate to your class. The keys are in two halves and should be sellotaped together so that the second sheet is "inside" when folded. The document provides one copy of each private key, three copies of each public key and a small number of secret messages (that should be sent in code only) and a small number of public messages (that should be signed but need not be encoded).
